# MyFitnessPal_data_visualization
This is a CCExtractor's contribution task for GSOC2020. It is a basic website which will give a visualiztion of MyfitnessPal data on grafana.)

I have created a basic website which will take a .csv file and by clicking on 'import', the csv data will be stored a MySql data in the localhost. Then by clicking on 'Visualize', it will take you to a grafana page where visualised data can be seen.
